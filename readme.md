##Sieves of Eratosthenes
####Some implementations
First algorithm is the most common implementation to generate all prime numbers smaller than a number

Second algorithm takes in a range and numbers to be checked for primality and decides primality

Third algorithm takes in a range finds prime numbers, factorizes any numbers in that range
